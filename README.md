# EVStationScanner

A very simple application that scans for available EV stations in a certain location using the NewMotion API.

When an EV station becomes available in the configured location a notification is shown on screen.

Location ID's can be found by selecting them on the [NewMotion map](https://my.newmotion.com) and grabbing their corresponding ID's from the API call to the backend.

For personal use only...
